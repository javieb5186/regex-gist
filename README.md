# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

## Description

This repo is meant for GitHub gists. I have never done a gist and would like some practice to submit a gist. This gist is about regular expressions, or regex, so I can better understand how regex functions. Although this is an assignment for school, I really enjoyed studying and researching about regex.

### Websites

What I have found is that they both categorize and identify regex components differently, but I did get the jist of it.
